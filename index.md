# How to Build a Serial Frequency Generator and Oscilloscope with PyQt5, ESP32, and Arduino

As an embedded engineer, I enjoy creating real-time tools that simplify workflows. This project combines a **Serial Frequency Generator** and an **Arduino Oscilloscope** using PyQt5, ESP32, and Arduino.

## Project Overview

### Serial Frequency Generator
- Generates customizable signals (frequency, waveform, amplitude).
- Built with PyQt5, controlling an ESP32.
- Onboard LED for visual feedback.

### Arduino Oscilloscope
- Displays real-time signals received from the generator.
- Built with PyQt5, using Arduino Uno for data visualization.

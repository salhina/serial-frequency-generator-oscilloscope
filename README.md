# **How to Build a Serial Frequency Generator and Oscilloscope with PyQt5, ESP32, and Arduino**

As an embedded engineer, I enjoy creating real-time tools that simplify workflows. This project combines a **Serial Frequency Generator** and an **Arduino Oscilloscope** using PyQt5, ESP32, and Arduino, providing powerful tools for signal generation and visualization.

## **Project Overview**
This project consists of two main applications:

### **1. Serial Frequency Generator**
- Generates customizable signals, including adjustable frequency, waveform, and amplitude.
- Built with **PyQt5**, with an intuitive GUI for controlling an **ESP32**.
- Includes an onboard LED on the ESP32 for real-time visual feedback of the signal.

### **2. Arduino Oscilloscope**
- Captures and displays real-time signals generated by the Serial Frequency Generator.
- Built with **PyQt5**, with an intuitive GUI for data visualization using an **Arduino Uno**.
- Provides engineers with an accessible tool for signal analysis.

## **Hardware Setup**
The hardware setup connects the ESP32 (for signal generation) and the Arduino Uno (for signal visualization) directly via jumper wires. This simple configuration bridges signal generation and analysis.

## **Features**
- **Real-Time Signal Generation and Analysis**: Quickly generate and visualize signals for testing and debugging.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Modify signal frequency, amplitude, and waveform through an intuitive GUI.
- **Saved Data Support**: Analyze saved signals for post-experiment review.
